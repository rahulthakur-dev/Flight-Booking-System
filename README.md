## Flight Booking Backend

This repository is a monorepo showcasing a flight booking backend system built with a microservices architecture. It includes two independent services — `flight-service` and `booking-service` — both following clean code practices and structured using a custom [Node.js Project Template](https://github.com/rahulthakur-dev/nodejs-project-template).

---

## Repositories

- [Flight Service](https://github.com/rahulthakur-dev/flight-service)  
  Handles creation and management of flights, airports, and airline data.  
  Includes endpoints for managing routes, seat capacity, and scheduling.

- [Booking Service](https://github.com/rahulthakur-dev/booking-service)  
  Manages user bookings, ensures transactional safety during booking, and prevents overbooking.  
  Implements idempotent operations, locking, and automatic cleanup of stale records.

- [Node.js Project Template](https://github.com/rahulthakur-dev/nodejs-project-template)  
  A reusable, production-ready Node.js boilerplate with a clean folder structure, Sequelize integration, and environment setup.

---

## Tech Stack

- Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js  
- Database: MySQL  
- ORM: Sequelize  
- Architecture: Modular with clear separation of concerns — Controllers, Services, Repositories, Middlewares  
- Job Scheduling: Node-Cron for background tasks like stale booking cleanup  
- Environment Management: dotenv  
- Logging & Error Handling: Custom error classes and centralized logging setup

## Concepts & Features Implemented

### Idempotency
Booking API uses idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges or multiple bookings when the same request is retried.

### Transaction Management (ACID)
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability are ensured using Sequelize transactions during booking operations.  
Database rollbacks and error handling maintain integrity.

### Row-Level Locking
Utilized Sequelize’s `LOCK.UPDATE` to avoid race conditions and overbooking in concurrent booking scenarios.

### Cron Jobs
Automated deletion of expired or unpaid bookings using scheduled tasks (node-cron).

### Clean Code & Scalable Structure
Inspired by best practices: single responsibility, clear separation between business logic and infrastructure.  
Each microservice is independently scalable and testable.

### RESTful APIs
Well-defined routes with input validation, middleware, and controller-service flow.

---

## Testing & Validation

- Basic input validation using custom middleware  
- Sequelize model validation and transaction rollback on failures  
- Environment-specific configurations

---

## Setup & Deployment

Each microservice contains its own `README.md` for setup and deployment instructions. The services can be run individually.
